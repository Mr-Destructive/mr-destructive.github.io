      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, what a year! If 2021 was a start, 2022 was a year to convert a start into a goal. From collaborating on open-source projects to getting an internship, it was an exciting year! Created a couple dozen of projects(not finished as usual), wrote 40+ articles, did a couple of streams, learned the basics of golang, and spend 6 months as a backend dev intern at &lt;a href=&#34;https://thesolarlabs.com/&#34;&gt;Solarlabs&lt;/a&gt;, just a year that was awaited for the hard work over the span of 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is Machine Learning?</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We all hear about terms like &lt;code&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/code&gt;, and others, but what do they actually mean and why do you need to care about these as a developer. This won&amp;rsquo;t be a perfect guide in terms of experience but surely enough to get anyone through the basics of Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not the kind of article I write but, having such challenges can help me become a better technical writer, this is the challenge put forward in the Hashnode Bootcamp 4 to get out of my comfort zone. Here&amp;rsquo;s my take on what I know about Machine Learning till now (P.S. Half of the stuff I discovered and re-learned during writing).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello World!&lt;/strong&gt; This is an article in which I&amp;rsquo;ll introduce why Techstructive Blog exists and what it covers in brief. This is just a casual introduction to my blogging niche. P.S. It&amp;rsquo;s not any technical blog but has challenged me enough to write and complete it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Techstructive Blog is my personal blog hosted on GitHub pages as well as on  &lt;a href=&#34;https://techstructiveblog.hashnode.dev/&#34;&gt;Hashnode&lt;/a&gt;. It first started on Hashnode and soon created my own using Jekyll on GitHub pages. On this blog, I write articles mainly Vim, BASH, and some programming languages and tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Journey as a Technical Writer</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hello World! I am Meet Gor, a self-taught web developer, Linux enthusiast, and a newbie technical writer. I am currently studying in an Engineering college pursuing my B. Tech in I.T.  I love to explore new programming languages and technologies, create innovative projects, love to write stories and blogs like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-it-started&#34;&gt;How it started&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was learning Vim, I found the need to write some kind of cheatsheet for myself. So I started writing it, soon I realized I had written a kind of an article instead of a cheatsheet XD There were a lot of chunks of it unorganized but meaningful in some sense. So, from there I started to research on article writing. I found the term perfect for my techno feelings to express i.e. &amp;ldquo;Technical Writing&amp;rdquo;.  I soon landed on Hashnode, I knew Medium, GeeksforGeeks but found Hashnode absolutely perfect and much more viable to the creativity of an author.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am Meet a student and a self-taught web developer. I like to make and break stuff, especially when it comes to programming and Linux.
