      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2023, what a year! If you&amp;rsquo;re a developer and haven&amp;rsquo;t heard the word &amp;lsquo;AI&amp;rsquo; a million times, where have you been? With the introduction of Chat GPT in December 2022, the start of 2023 was buzzing with Open AI&amp;rsquo;s flagship product. I also did a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetgor.com/2022-review/&#34;&gt;2022 review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The year 2023 was a pivotal year for me to gain experience in solving and delivering real-world problems to solutions. I went from a code-first approach to a code-last approach for solving a problem. The year was not ideal for freshers, as from the end of 2022 till 2023 there was a huge round of layoffs in big tech companies. The competition was too much for freshers and the AI hype added salt to the injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, what a year! If 2021 was a start, 2022 was a year to convert a start into a goal. From collaborating on open-source projects to getting an internship, it was an exciting year! Created a couple dozen of projects(not finished as usual), wrote 40+ articles, did a couple of streams, learned the basics of golang, and spend 6 months as a backend dev intern at &lt;a href=&#34;https://thesolarlabs.com/&#34;&gt;Solarlabs&lt;/a&gt;, just a year that was awaited for the hard work over the span of 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
