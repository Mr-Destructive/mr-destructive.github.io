I was live streaming, creating a AI Coding Agent from scratch in Python. I was excited to create the agent. You can watch the [livestream](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx2AcRqaYcMgAqZgtA2k48iYb8sJf9VL6F?si=XTtC2zFs2Kloia0L) here. 

Anyways, the thing is the uv python project has a `. python_version` file that will store the python version.

I thought, it might be used from `pyproject.toml`, or other setup files. But that is really neat from uv.
